# FirstStepsOpenGL

Following tutorials to learn and understand graphics processing with the dream to someday work for WETA studios.

The goal is to make one unique code contribution a day for 3 years.

Any commits marked with "OWN CODE" are my attempts to go off the tutorial and try to apply what I have learned.

While following the tutorial I will attempt to make my own comments to understand what each line is doing.
